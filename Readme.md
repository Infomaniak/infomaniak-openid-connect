## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before configuring the plugin, you must create an OAuth2 application in your Infomaniak space:

1. Log into your Infomaniak account
2. Access the API and applications management section
3. Create a new OAuth2 application
4. Note the client ID and client secret that will be provided to you
5. Configure the redirect URL to: `https://your-site.com/openid-connect-authorize`

### Plugin Settings

Access the plugin configuration page (Settings > OpenID Connect Infomaniak) and fill in the following information:

- **Client ID**: The identifier of your Infomaniak OAuth2 application
- **Client Secret**: The secret of your Infomaniak OAuth2 application
- **Authorization URL**: URL of the Infomaniak authorization endpoint
- **Token URL**: URL of the Infomaniak token endpoint
- **User Information URL**: URL of the Infomaniak user information endpoint
- **Authentication Scope**: The required OAuth2 scopes (typically "openid email profile")

## Usage

Once configured, the plugin will automatically add a "Login with Infomaniak" button to your WordPress login form. Users can click this button to be redirected to the Infomaniak authentication page.

After successful authentication, users will be redirected to your WordPress site and automatically logged in. If it's their first login, a WordPress account will be automatically created with their Infomaniak profile information.

## Customization

The plugin offers several customization options:

- Login button text and appearance
- Post-authentication redirect behavior
- Automatic user account creation and updates
- User information mapping between Infomaniak and WordPress

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the plugin:

1. Verify that the client ID and client secret are correctly entered
2. Ensure that the redirect URL is properly configured in the Infomaniak application
3. Check the plugin's options log for more information about potential errors
4. Verify that Infomaniak's OAuth2 endpoints are accessible from your server
